# Unit Tests

This directory contains unit tests for individual classes, methods, and functions in isolation.

Unit tests should:
- Test small, focused pieces of functionality
- Mock dependencies
- Run quickly
- Not require database or external services

Example unit tests:
- Testing helper functions
- Testing individual model methods without database
- Testing configuration parsing
- Testing utility classes
